		WHY ORGANIC?
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div class="header-description">
        Organic products are not just boutique characteristics of high end food and agricultural products, they offer 	much, much more. We initially made these confections for our family and didn't want foods laced with any 		unknown combination of funigicdes, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, or antibiotics, and we didn't think you'd want to either. Here are our top 5 reasons:
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="reasons-list">
    
        <div class="reason-container">
            <div class="reason-title"> 1. Reduce persistent chemicals and pesticides. </div>	<!--Reason num.1-->
            <div class="reason-description">
                Buying organic food promotes a less toxic environment for all living things.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reason-container">
            <div class="reason-title"> 2. Avoid rBGH, GMOs, sub-therapeautic anti-bodies, and cloned food.</div>
            <div class="reason-description">
                These food technologies have been rushed to the market with little to no long-term testing.
                Should our children be the guinea pigs for these tests? Most European counties ban most of
                these practices outright.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reason-container">
            <div class="reason-title"> 3. Reduce, if not eliminate, off-farm pollution.</div>	<!--Reason num.3-->
            <div class="reason-description">
                The chemicals used to grow our crops and feed our cattle don't just go away.
                They flow downstream. Genetically modified seeds can be blown across fields,
                cross-pollinating other crops. Industrial farming waste pollutes communities and
                creates river and ocean dead zones.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reason-container">
            <div class="reason-title"> 4. Better taste, and richer in nutrients.</div>	<!--Reason num.4-->
            <div class="reason-description">
                Researchers are slowly becoming aware that organics prove to be a
                much better option in nutritional vale and taste better too.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reason-container">
            <div class="reason-title"> 5. Eating with a sense of place.</div>	<!--Reason num.5-->
            <div class="reason-description">
                Organic foods demonstrate a reverance for the land and it's people. Organics use less energy
                and their cultivation is beneficial to the soil, water, farmers and local inhabitants.
