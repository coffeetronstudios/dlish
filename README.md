Website for our client, DLish Organics.

### Developer Setup

This site is built using Jekyll and LESS. On a Mac or Linux machine, install the
required modules by running the following command line (only needs to be done once):

    sudo gem update --system
    sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-less therubyracer

To start editing the site, run the following command (each time you sit down for a development session):

    cd <path to site folder>
    jekyll --server --auto

Open your browser to <http://localhost:4000> and you're ready to go.
